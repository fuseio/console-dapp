# Connectors

Web3Auth Wagmi Connector currently doesn't allow variable ids, so we are restricted to using only one social login.

Connectors is a solution to create Web3Auth Wagmi connector instance for all social logins. It's a fork of [web3auth-wagmi-connector connector.ts](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector/blob/f33ddbb9f66ff5c052b0b06e0b40829bc9d83f17/src/lib/connector.ts).
